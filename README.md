MonteCarloVowels
================

A program for calculating the optimization of vowel systems. The program takes mean
formant values for F1, F2, and F3 for a given language, and calculates how optimized
that system is by comparing it to random distributions of vowels within a space of
approximately the same size. The method uses Liljencrants and Lindblom's (1972)
measure of energy in a vowel space.

Example
-------

analyse("Zulu", 10000, "mel")

Returns a z-score. The higher the z-score, the less likely the system is to have been
produced by chance, and therefore the more optimized that system is.
